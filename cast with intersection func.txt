determine next vertical and horizontal lines in ray direction and intersect ray with each
while true
	determine which intersection was closer (intersection.x)
	determine which tile the ray enters (intersection.y) and its type
	if wall
		output distance, texture, position in tile
		break
	else if door
		...
		if hit
			output distance, texture, position in tile
			break
	else if sprite
		...
		select unused sprite hit slot
		store distance, texture, position in tile
	move to next line in that direction and update intersection
